  <h1>Privacy Policy 🌿</h1>
  <p><strong>SoulGarden</strong> is designed to be your safe and peaceful space to reflect and grow emotionally. We respect your privacy deeply and are committed to keeping your data secure.</p>

  <h2>🔒 What We Store</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Your Telegram ID and username (to identify your entries)</li>
    <li>Your text memories, mood selections, and optional voice notes</li>
    <li>Basic stats like points and streaks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>👂 Voice Notes</h2>
  <p>Voice notes are stored on our server so you can listen to them in your personal garden. They are never shared publicly unless you choose to share your garden through "Explore".</p>

  <h2>🙈 Data Visibility</h2>
  <p>Memories shown in the Explore section are always <strong>anonymous</strong>. Your name is never displayed there.</p>

  <h2>🗑️ Deleting Your Data</h2>
  <p>You can delete all your data anytime using the <code>/delete</code> command in the bot. This action is permanent.</p>

  <h2>🔐 Encryption</h2>
  <p>While SoulGarden uses secure server storage, it is not end-to-end encrypted like messaging apps. Do not use the bot for sensitive or private information you wouldn’t want stored.</p>
